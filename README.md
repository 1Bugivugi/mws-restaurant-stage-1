## Project Overview

This project is a part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree and the Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course.
Udacity's overview for this project states:
"For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users."
[...]
"You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality."

## Credits

* The [Study Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXwlOAXUko) and the [Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsGs9z7TuyY) by Mohamed Riaad were great
resources to learn more about the basics of the project, to revise ARIA roles
and labels and to brush up my knowledge about accessibility auditioning with the
Lighthouse extension to the Google Dev tools.
* Also, thanks to Jake Archibald and Mike Wales from Udacity, for their great teaching skills on the Service Worker and Benefits of Offline 1st!
